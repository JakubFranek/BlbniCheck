# Ideas for future improvements
1. Double clicking Status column toggles Task Done property
2. TableView Status icons are somehow low-res (but not for me! Maybe something to do with scaling?)
3. When a Task is originally created with no Date Due, but it is added later on via Edit, the default is min value (should be current date)
